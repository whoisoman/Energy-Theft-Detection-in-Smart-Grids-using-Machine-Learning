# Energy Theft Detection in Smart Grids using Machine Learning

Energy theft is a major issue in smart grids, leading to huge financial losses.
This project uses Machine Learning (ML) to detect abnormal energy consumption patterns that may indicate theft.

We simulate smart grid data, preprocess it, train ML models, and visualize predictions.
